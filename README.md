The project received a grade of 30/30 and has been selected as the winner of the "[Accattivante Accessibile 2025](https://ilbolive.unipd.it/it/event/ateneo/accattivante-accessibile)" contest organized by the University of Padua.

>BookOverflow is the place where books never end. 
>Like [_StackOverflow_](https://stackoverflow.com/) for programmers, here book lovers discover an "overflow" of stories, connections, and possibilitiesâ€”all without spending a single penny.  
>
>The beauty of BookOverflow lies in its ability to transform forgotten books on shelves into opportunities, while also committing to reducing the environmental impact of the publishing industry by promoting *sustainable* practices.
